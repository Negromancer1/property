      <p>When people think about rights, they think about all the things that they can do, but did you know that you also have rights over your property? That is what property rights are all about. Property rights are a huge issue around the world that I care about, and it’s the reason why I’m writing this article. It’s always annoying when people think they have the liberty to use my things without my permission. You can control what other people can do on your property and what they can’t do. That one person who is constantly using your pencil without your permission is actually violating your Property rights, and you can report them if you want to.

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Stealing</h1>
      <p>There is one right that is constantly violated, and arguably the most severe, stealing. I'm sure everyone knows what stealing is and probably witnessed or heard of people doing it. For the uneducated, stealing is when you take something that doesn’t belong to you. Stealing is considered a violation of property rights since they don’t have your consent to take the property. If you steal something and get caught, it would probably go down permanently in your record, and it will be harder finding a good job/college. If you stole something that is more valuable, you could even get sent to jail. You cannot just go up to something you like, and just take it and run away. Stealing is like your parents grounding you, which takes away a lot of your rights without your permission.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal" >Trespassing</h1>
      <p>Here is another property right that most people are familiar with, trespassing. Trespassing means to go into land that doesn’t belong to you. You probably have seen a lot of signs out there that say no trespassing, and when you see that, you know they are serious about trespassing. You see, if you were to trespass, you would be walking on their land that they bought with their own money. Since they bought the land, they now have full control, or to have sovereignty over that piece of land as it is now their property. Since they didn’t give you permission to go on their land, and they have said they don’t want you on their land by putting the sign up, you will most likely get reported to the police if you walk on their land.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Eminent Domain</h1>
      <p>Another important part of private property rights is eminent domain. Eminent domain is the right for the government to take away property from other people, but only if they can reimburse the owner of the property, and if it is for the greater good. There have been many cases of eminent domain abuse, such as the time in 1997 when Simon deBartolo's company bought a lot of homes in a small neighborhood, since he wanted to expand his mall there, but a lot of homeowners there refused to move. The city manager of Hurst, Jeff Jones knew that the mall was the biggest taxpayer in the small city, so he used eminent domain to get rid of all the remaining people in the neighborhood. The remaining people filed lawsuits, but in the end, the supreme court decided Simon’s corporation the winner of the lawsuit, and kicked the homeowners off their property. This is a huge offense to private property rights since they kicked the homeowners off their own property, and even the supreme court didn’t help them. Eminent domain is an issue since the government can take property away from anyone they want without their consent, and they can’t do anything about it even if the government is abusing this power. There is really no way for people to stop this from happening, as the government can always claim that “it is good for the people”, and eminent domain is the only way for the government to take other people’s property.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Solution</h1>
      <p>I think now that you are familiar with the most common forms of violation of property rights, let’s move on to a solution to end this. No matter where you are or what you are doing, it is best to keep property rights on the back of your mind. Try to not touch or use other people’s property without their consent, no matter what. You should ask them if you can use their things if you really want to. 
<br><br>


If you have someone that is violating your property rights, see if it is a serious offense or not. If it is serious, like if someone is throwing rocks at your newly bought car, you should just go call the police. If it is not that serious, such as someone using your pencil without your permission, you should just go talk to them, and tell them that you don’t want them touching your property. By saying that, you have firmly told them that they are violating your property rights, and if they do continue, you should be able to report them to someone with power. I will tell you that most of the time, when you tell someone to stop interacting with your property, they will most likely stop.

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Conclusion</h1>
      <p>If everyone respects others' property rights, this wouldn’t be a problem. So by telling them that you don’t want them interacting with your items, you can possibly reduce the violations of people using things without others permission, and every little bit helps. I feel like this would affect me quite a bit if people actually started respecting other people’s property, since many people have used things I bought without my consent, and it is quite annoying. In conclusion, you should always respect other people’s property, and make sure to guard your property well.</p>
